## Description

This code sample demonstrates building a Copilot Extension using the skillsets approach rather than a traditional agent. This extension is designed to generate random test and example data for a number of development purposes, by calling publicly available APIs.

### Architectural Model
- **Skillsets**: Define up to 5 API endpoints that Copilot can call directly. Copilot handles all AI interactions, prompt engineering, and response formatting.
- **Agents**: Provide full control over the interaction flow, including custom prompt crafting and specific LLM model selection.

### When to Choose Skillsets
Skillsets are ideal when you want to:
- Quickly integrate existing APIs or services without managing AI logic
- Focus purely on your service's core functionality
- Maintain consistent Copilot-style interactions without extensive development
- Get started with minimal infrastructure and setup

Use agents instead if you need:
- Complex custom interaction flows
- Specific LLM model control (using LLMs that aren't provided by the Copilot API)
- Custom prompt crafting
- Advanced state management

## Example Implementation

This extension showcases the skillset approach by providing three simple endpoints that generate random development data:
- Random commit messages
- Lorem ipsum text generation
- Random user data

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: 

```
git clone git@github.com:copilot-extensions/skillset-example.git
cd skillset-example
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
go mod tidy
```

## Usage

1. Start up ngrok with the port provided:

```
ngrok http http://localhost:8080
```

2. Set the environment variables (use the ngrok generated url for the `FDQN`)
3. Run the application:

```
go run .
```

## Accessing the Extension in Chat:

1. In the `Copilot` tab of your Application settings (`https://github.com/settings/apps/<app_name>/agent`)
- Set the app type to "Skillset"
- Specify the following skills
```
Name: random_commit_message
Inference description: Generates a random commit message
URL: https://<your ngrok domain>/random-commit-message
Parameters: { "type": "object" }
Return type: String
---
Name: random_lorem_ipsum 
Inference description: Generates a random Lorem Ipsum text.  Responses should have html tags present.
URL: https://<your ngrok domain>/random-lorem-ipsum
Parameters: 
{
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
      "number_of_paragraphs": {
         "type": "number",
         "description": "The number of paragraphs to be generated.  Must be between 1 and 10 inclusive"
      },
      "paragraph_length": {
         "type": "string",
         "description": "The length of each paragraph.  Must be one of \"short\", \"medium\", \"long\", or \"verylong\""
      }
   }
}
Return type: String
---
Name: random_user
Inference description: Generates data for a random user
URL: https://<your ngrok domain>/random-user
Parameters: { "type": "object" }
Return type: String
```

2. In the `General` tab of your application settings (`https://github.com/settings/apps/<app_name>`)
- Set the `Callback URL` to anything (`https://github.com` works well for testing, in a real environment, this would be a URL you control)
- Set the `Homepage URL` to anything as above
3. Ensure your permissions are enabled in `Permissions & events` > 
- `Account Permissions` > `Copilot Chat` > `Access: Read Only`
4. Ensure you install your application at (`https://github.com/apps/<app_name>`)
5. Now if you go to `https://github.com/copilot` you can `@` your skillset extension using the name of your app.

## What can the bot do?

Here's some example things:

* `@skillset-example please create a random commit message`
* `@skillset-example generate a lorem ipsum`
* `@skillset-example generate a short lorem ipsum with 3 paragraphs`
* `@skillset-example generate random user data`

## Implementation

This bot provides a passthrough to a couple of other APIs:

* For commit messages, https://whatthecommit.com/
* For Lorem Ipsum, https://loripsum.net/
* For user data, https://randomuser.me/
